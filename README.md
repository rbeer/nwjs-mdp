Reveals GitHub API request limit values on click.  
The icon indicates 3 states by its color:

  - ![](./img/github_16.png) - >= 10% of available API calls left
  - ![](./img/github_16_warn.png) - < 10% calls left
  - ![](./img/github_16_err.png) - No API calls left

When you have no API calls left, you can either wait the rest of the hour (since your first request out of 60/h) for the limit
to reset or request an auth token with your GitHub account.  
You can right click the icon and get a token, right away.

### app._debug

The debug mode augments the main app (or `window.app`) with a `_debug` object. It's members are

  - **`exceedUnauthedRatioLimit`** [[docs](https://rbeer.github.io/nwjs-mdp/jsdoc/0.1.0/module-_debug.html#.simulateRatioLimitError)]  
    Exceeds GitHub API call limit for unauthorized users. WARNING: This will, like _for
    realz_, ban your current IP from making anymore API calls, until the reset period
    (up to 1h) is over. _"I repeat, this is not a drill! ~chrrck~ "_
  - **`simulateRatioLimitError`** [[docs](https://rbeer.github.io/nwjs-mdp/jsdoc/0.1.0/module-_debug.html#.exceedUnauthedRatioLimit)]  
    Simulates exceeded ratio limit to debug error page. This one really is a simulation.
    It doesn't make a single API call.
